# Spark Hackathon Node Server

Welcome to the Spark Hackathon!

Contained is a simple express server example written in TypeScript that calls most of our exposed sdk functions.

To get started:

```
yarn
yarn dev
```

or if you'd like you can copy this directory as a starting template for your own project and use a different package manager like npm:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

To init a new wallet, make an empty POST request to either.

```
https://localhost:{PORT}/spark-wallet/init
```

or

```
https://localhost:{PORT}/issuer-wallet/init
```

Your mnemonic should then get saved to your local machine and you can explore our api from there.

**To spin up a new wallet, delete the saved mnemonic files.**

If your server crashes, remember to init your wallet again.

You can find more documentation for our sdks at https://docs.spark.info

## Bitcoin Network configuration

To change the bitcoin network, update the `BITCOIN_NETWORK` variable in [`./src/index.ts`](./src/index.ts#L13).

## Postman Collection for testing:

You can import the below collection into postman to test the endpoints in dev.  
There are default values set in the `body` > `raw` of POST requests that you can easily edit.

Not all Spark Wallet endpoints are included in the Issuer Wallet folder.
If there are methods from the Spark SDK you want to call with your Issuer Wallet, just add the endpoints as /issuer-wallet/... to the Issuer Wallet folder.

[Spark SDK API](./spark-sdk-api.postman_collection.json)
